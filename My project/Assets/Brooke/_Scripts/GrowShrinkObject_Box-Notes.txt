COMPONENTS:
- GameObject
- SpriteRenderer
- Collider2D (shape dependent on object)
- Animator
	- sizeState boolean
	- Animations
- GrowShrinkObject_Box (Script)
	- Object State
	- Small Box Collider Size
	- Small Box Collider Offset
	- Big Box Collider Size
	- Big Box Collider Offset
	
Script Explanation:
	- Object has a public ENUM for two possible states: SMALL and Big
	- Script holds Vector2 data for boxCollider data for both states, can be modified in editor
	- OnMouseDown(): 
		- Calls SwapState()
	- SwapState():
		- If the object is not currently animating (tracked by boolean),
			- If object is SMALL, set state to BIG, set the animator 'sizeState' to true, and edit the boxCollider size to be the BIG one
			- If object is BIG, vice versa
	- DoneAnimating():
		- Used by the animator at the end of the growing/shrinking animations via an animation event to toggle isAnimating to false.
		
Animator:
	- Four animations attached, Small State, Small to Big, Big State, and Big to Small
	- Animator and Animation Files should be created for each object, stored in a subfolder under wherever you keep your sprites for these objects
	- Has a boolean sizeState, set FALSE if starting SMALL, TRUE if starting BIG
	- Entry animation should link to the object's starting state
	- Transitions from Small State -> Small to Big and Big State -> Big to Small should have an appropriate Condition check on the boolean, no Exit Time, no Fixed Duration, and 0 Transition Duration/Offset
	- Transitions from Small to Big -> Big State and Big to Small -> Small State should have no condition checks, an Exit time of 1, and 0 Transition Duration/Offset
